Soccer Match Outcome Predictor
This project leverages data scraping and machine learning to predict future outcomes of Premier League matches. It consists of two main components:

Data Scraping - Collects match and team data from web sources to build a comprehensive dataset for model training.
Machine Learning Prediction - Uses the scraped data to train a predictive model that forecasts the results of upcoming matches.

Project Overview
1. Data Scraping
The scraping.ipynb notebook scrapes match statistics, team rankings, and historical performance metrics to create a dataset for model training. Data from multiple seasons ensures a balanced dataset that captures seasonal variations and team dynamics.

2. Predictive Modeling
The prediction.ipynb notebook cleans and prepares the scraped data, performs feature engineering, and applies machine learning algorithms to predict match outcomes. The model evaluates various factors such as team strength, recent performance, and other key metrics to generate predictions.

Features
Web Scraping: Streamlined data collection process for analysis.
Predictive Machine Learning Model: Forecasts match results based on statistical analysis and training on historical data.
Feature Engineering: Optimizes input data for more accurate model predictions.

Future Work
Expand to additional leagues.
Experiment with advanced ML models or deep learning.
Integrate visualization for match predictions.
